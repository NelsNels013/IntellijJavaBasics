What is super keyword:
    super keyword in java is used to refer to the parent class object.
Why should we learn super keyword.
    1) if we have the same name variable or method in the super/parent/base class then we
    can use the super keyword to refer to parent class variable or method by
    default Java prefers the variable of child class. We can also call the super class
    constructor with the help of super with parenthesis/ super();
How to use super keyword:
    1) we can use super., method name, or field name to call the method or to access that
    field of super class.
    2) use the super with parenthesis to call the super class constructor.

Rules:
    1) We can only access the immediate parent class constructor or filed or method
    with the help of super keyword.
    2) When can only use super() inside a constructor.
    3) If we have a user created constructor in the parent class we must have a matching constructor
    inside the child classes as well.
    4) If we have multiple constructors inside the parent as sson as one is matched we are god to go.
    We don't need to match each and every constructor from the parent class.
    5) super() should be first line inside constructor

what is MethodOverLoading:
    When same name method exists in a class but with different number of parameters or
    different type of parameters or differetn sequence of parameters it is claaed
    methodOverLoading.
Why we should use MethodOverLoading:
    1) Makes your code more readable.
    2) Makes the life of the end users easy, they don't have to memorize many
    method names.

How we can use methodOverLoading.
    We can have the same name methods, but we have to follow the rules below
    1) by passing different number of parameters
    2) we can change the datatype of parameters.
    3) we can also overload a method by changing the sequence of parameters.
