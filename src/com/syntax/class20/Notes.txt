What is Inheritance:
     is a mechanism in Java through which one class acquires the properties and methods of
     another class.
Why we should use Inheritance:
     1) it helps reduce the amount of code that we have to write.
     2) it is more efficient.
     3) Saves memory.
How we can use Inheritance:
     We can use the extends keyword after the class name and then the name of the class
     from which we want to inherit the code. Example is given below.
class Parent{
String name="Newton";
String eyeColor="brown";
}
class Child extends Parent{

public void printInfo(){
System.out.println(name+" "+eyeColor);
}
}

Types of Inheritance:
     Different languages support different types f inheritance but 5 are very common.
     1) Single Inheritance.
     2) Multilevel Inheritance.
     3) Hierarchy Inheritance.
     4) Multiple Inheritance.
     5) Hybrid Inheritance.
