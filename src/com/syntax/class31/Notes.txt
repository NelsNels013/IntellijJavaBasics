File Handling:
    Reading/Writing data to a file is called fileHandling.
Why FileHandling is important:
    The data that changes frequently, we don't put that data with code because if we have to change that data, we need
    to recompile that code and redeploy the code on production servers again, it's a very lengthy process and might take
    weeks. The other issue is we might accidentally change the code as well when changing the data and might introduce
    bugs.
How to handle files in Java:
    We follow below steps to read and write data to files.
    1) We need to know the path of file.
    2) Navigate to that location using FileInputStream if we are planning to read the data from a file and
    FileOutputStream if we are planning to write the data from a file.
    3) Need to use the proper class that can handle that file, for example if we need to read/write data from properties
    class, we can use the Properties class and XSSFWorkbook class for example Excel files.
How to create Properties file.
    1) Right-click on the folder in which we want to create the file
    2) Click on the new -> File, give any name to the file and after, write the extension as properties
