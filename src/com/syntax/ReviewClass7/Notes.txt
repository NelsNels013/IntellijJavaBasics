Types of variables in Java:
    We have three types of variables 1)local 2)instance 3)static.
Local variables:
    Are the variables that we declared inside the block of code.
    pro:They occupy the memory for shortest period of time.
    con: They cannot be accessed outside that block in which they are declared
Instance Variables:
    Are the variables that are declared inside a class but outside a block of code.
    pro: Can be accessed in all the methods of class. They can have different values for each
    instance of that class.
Static variables:
    All the variables which are defined outside a block of code with static keyword they are
    called static variables.
    pro: 1) They only reserve a single memory location for all the instance of a class.
    2) They can be accessed by just writing the name of the class and variable name.
    con: They occupy the memory for longest period of time, they always store only one value
    for all the objects of that class.

Real life use: Most of the time you will be storing constant values in static variables.
    static is also used heavily with methods that don't involve instance variables.
Access Modifiers:
    There are 3 access modifier keywords(private, protected, public) and four access(private,
    default, protected, public) in Java.
Rules:
    Access modifiers can only be used with instance and static members
    of a class(fields and methods)
Private:
    When we use private with any method or variable, we can only access that method or
    variable in that class.

Default(not a keyword):
    We can access that member inside that same class inside the same package in other classes.
Public:
    When we use the public access modifier with members of a class it is available throughout
    that project.
Real life use:
    99% of the time instance fields are always private.
    99% of the time instance and static methods are always public.
