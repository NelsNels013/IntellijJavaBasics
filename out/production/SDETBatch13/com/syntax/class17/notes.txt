Access Modifiers:
     Access modifiers are keywords in Java that help us control the access of
     classes, variables, methods and other code of bloc. There are four access levels in java
     private, default(it's not a keyword), protected, and public
     define these access levels 1)private 2)protected 3)public
Private:
     When we use the private keyword with a method or field it is only accessible inside that class.
     it is the most restricted access modifier.
Default(it's not a keyword):
     When we don't use any access modifier keyword with a field or method then default access is applied
     by java which means we can access this variable or method inside the same as well as in all the other
     classes which exist inside the same package.
Protected:
     When we have protected access modifier we can access that method or variable inside the same class + inside
     the classes which are inside the same package + inside the classes which are in different packages
     as well, but they must have extends relationship with the origin class.
Public:
     When we use the public access modifiers we can use hat field or method anywhere inside
     the same project. We can access them in the class + in the package +
