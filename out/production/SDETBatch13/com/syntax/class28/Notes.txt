What is List:
    List is an interface inside the collections' framework, which have below properties.
    1) Insertion order is maintained.
    2) I can store duplicate data.
List is implemented by many classes, but we will be focusing on ArrayList and linkedList:
ArrayList:
    When my requirement is that I will be reading the data a lot, then I should be going
    with ArrayList.
LinkedList:
    Most of our operations will be writing the data to a list in between or in the start
    or shifting the data, we should be going with LinkedList.
