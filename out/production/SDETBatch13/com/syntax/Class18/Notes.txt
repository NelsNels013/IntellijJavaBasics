What is a Constructor in Java:
    A Constructor is a special block of code that helps us give initial values to the fields
    of a class. Initialization of object or instance.
Why we should use a Constructor.
    1) When we use the Constructor to initialize the object it looks more readable and cleaner.
    2) If the fields of a class are private, it's not possible to access them outside a class without
    constructor or a method, which means we can't initialize them without a method or a constructor.
    3) we can enforce rules like what kind of values are assigned to variables with the help of
    a constructor.
    4) If we want to make sure that some lines of code should always be executed when the object of
    a class is created we can put that code inside the constructor.
How to use Constructor.
    We create the constructor inside the class and when an object of that class
    is created the constructor is executed automatically.
class Car{
String make;
String model;

Car(String carMake, String carModel){
make=carMake;
model=carModel;
}

public static void main(String[] args){
Car bmw=new Car("BMW","M5Comp);
}
}

Rules:
    1) Constructors don't have return types, not even void.
    2) The name of the constructor should always be the same as name of the class.
    3) Constructor can't be created with a static keyword.
    4) We can use any access modifiers with Constructors.
    5) If we don't create a constructor in a class, a default constructor with zero parameters
    is created with compiler.(Takes the code written by us, and it converts that code to byte code
    which is easier for Java to understand).
    6) It is not allowed to have two constructors in a class wih same number of parameters and same type.
this keyword:
    We can use the "this" keyword to access the instance variables when you have same named variables in your
    method or constructor or any block of code.

this():
    Calls the constructors of a class inside other constructor.
    why we should use it? because it helps us reuse already written constructors if they contain same code.
    why we want to create multiple constructors in the first place? because we want to give end user flexibility
    that he can create the objects of our class in many ways
