What is method overriding in Java:
    When same method with same header exists in the child class we call it method
    overriding
Why we should override a method:
    If we inherit from a class, all the methods which are not private, they are inherited in
    the child class. Now if we don't like some of these methods may because they consume more
    internet bandwidth or consume a lot of CPU or uses a lot of memory we can override them
    in the child class.
How we can use method Overriding.
    1) We must first inherit from a class.
    2) We can redeclare the method with the same return.
Example:

class Parent{

}
void eat(){
System.out.println("I like to eat Steak");
}
void sleep(){
System.out.println("I like to sleep 8 hours a day");
}
}
class Child extends Parent{

void eat(){
System.out.println("I like to eat Pizza");
}
}
Rule:
    1) We must have a super class base class relationship.
    2) Method in the parent and child class must have same headers, but they can be
    different in terms of access modifiers and in very rear conditions in terms of return
    type.
    3) We can't change the access modifiers from public to protected or default but we can
    do it in reverse order.
    4) We can't override constructors because they are also not inherited.
    5) If a method is static we use a different terminology, it's called method redeclaration
    instead of overriding.
